# Week 1 Tech Educators Assignment
## Space Y Website Build
### A basic website build to demonstrate / practice some fundatmental HTML & CSS skills.

Some JavaScript is included to reveal a video player. 
Click the "WATCH NOW" button under "SHIPFLIGHT VIDEO" to reveal a YouTube video, then click play. 

#### Future additions to this project might include; 

+ Applying JavaScript in the second and third sections of the webpage to reveal relavent information.
  - A table showing the different tiers of tickets available to buy with prices.
  - Text in some format to show any current deals on travel packages. Perhaps a countdown timer till the deal ends. Marketing wise this would be both on theme with the website and increase buyer urgency.
+ Making the website more responsive.
  - As it stands the video player when revealed is a static size. This should adjust to the size of the screen.
  - Using JavaScript, the nav menu in the header could become a hamburger menu when viewed on smaller screen sizes.
